# GopherScript
## CoffeeScript inspired language that compiles to Go

> NOTE: This is a learning project and should only be looked at by those wanting
to laugh at terrible Go code

This is a learning project attempting to implement a language that is inspired by
CoffeeScript that compiles to simple Go code.

The language itself will be dynamically typed (against my better judgement) and
will hopefully have a more functional lean ala Scheme.

Painless Go interop is also going to be a major goal.
